- [x] Decode String (Medium)
> Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

_Use stack for an iterative solution. When coming across a `[` character, put a `current` decoded string onto a stack (together with a quantifier preceding given `[`) and start building a new `current` until hitting `]`._
